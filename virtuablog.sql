For that reason itself, the smug righteousness with which he makes his comments gets my goat.\r\n\r\nOne of his big arguments is that John Buchanan is a failed cricketer? Maybe that is true but I would politely suggest that 99.9% of the Indian population is a failed cricketer. Who in our country wouldn\'t be a world class cricketer if he had the choice? I would, for one. If Sunny bhai feels that to be a factor, then first he should tell the Indian public to shut up with their thoughts on how cricket should be run and who the captain and the playing eleven should be for every match.

For someone who has been on thousands of committees, sub-committees, panels and advisory teams, his notable contributions to cricket after retirement are notable by their absence. Sunny also is not someone who would just be on some committee or other for the betterment of the game; like they say \'it takes a milker to know one\'.

Cricket is a game that is played between two opposing sides, where generally the side that executes better on the day ends up winning. On a more macro level the same is fundamental to any sport. Even those played between individuals, like tennis or golf. The individual or the team that executes the skill or set of skills which are on display, better than the opposition, generally comes up trumps.\r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes this is not necessarily the case. Teams or individuals who are better placed to win at the start of the game and/or may also display a better performance during the course of the game are stalled in their march to victory by an intangible element. This intangible may on some occasions delay the onset of victory for the opposition, if not completely deny it.\r\n\r\nIn the game between Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals, this past Thursday, this latent intangible manifested itself yet again. It once again donned the guise of a champion sportsman\'s will power, his tenacity not to give in without a fight, his ability to inspire his team from a seemingly hopeless position. Since the time Shane Warne came out to bat in the penultimate over of the Royals innings, he had a tonic like effect on the fortunes of his side. The little known Abhishek Raut looked to be feeding off Warne\'s energy and played a cameo late in the Royals innings that proved to be invaluable in the overall scheme of things.', 'uploads/106347rajsthan_225.jpg', 'uploads/35349', 'uploads/414233', 'undefined', 'approve'),

Because in 1989, at the tender age of sixteen he tore into a thirty four year old veteran - Abdul Qadir with gusto and made the world take note of his precocious talent.\r\n\r\n2. Because on witnessing his innings of 114 at the WACA in the fifth test of 1991-1992 series against Australia, the eminent cricket journalist John Woodcock stood up, put out his hands and called for silence. \"Gentlemen,\" Woodcock declared, \"he is the best batsman I have seen in my life.\" A pause later: \"And unlike most of you, I have seen Bradman.\"\r\n\r\n3.

Of the lot, I had bet only on the Daredevils making it through to the semifinals. In this blog, I shall preview the remaining teams in the tournament.\r\n\r\nThe Bangalore Royal Challengers made news in last year\'s tournament with the sacking of their CEO Charu Sharma for the team\'s disastrous performance. This year also there is already a buzz about the team given that the Royal Challenger\'s made history by buying Kevin Pietersen at USD 1.55 million. However, this does not necessarily translate into more wins for the Royal Challengers since Pietersen will not be available for more than 50% of the league stage (on international duty for the series against West Indies in early May 09).\r\n\r\nJesse Ryder is a good acquisition given his recent scores in international cricket and this would add to the batting strength of the side (Dravid, Kallis, Uthappa & Vira Kohli) even in Pietersen\'s absence. But with Zaheer Khan moving to the Mumbai Indians in exchange for Robin Uthappa, the bowling department will be largely dependent on Dale Steyn. This and how they will field their four best foreign players with Pietersen and Chanderpaul around, adds to their problems.\r\n\r\nThe losing finalists from last year â€“ the Chennai Super Kings should continue their good run into this year\'s tournament. Their acquisition of Andrew Flintoff (also at USD 1.55 million) should pay rich dividends till the time he is available (off on international duty for the series against West Indies in early May 09). Also with Mathew Hayden, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Suresh Raina expected to bludgeon bowling attacks into submission, it would be difficult to stop the Super Kings from winning the second edition of the tournament. The presence of Makhaya Ntini, Manpreet Gony, Albie Morkel and Muttiah Muralitharan also gives a well rounded feel to their bowling attack.

In this post, I hope to shed some light on the three teams from the north which include the defending champions.\r\n\r\nThe Kings XI Punjab, were one of the firebrand franchisees from the last edition with a strong batting lineup that boasted of names like Shaun Marsh, Yuvraj Singh, Kumara Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene.

But then history has waxed eloquent of folks who have challenged the odds. In Yuvraj\'s case, other than for a superb century in the second test of the historic Indian tour to Pakistan in early 2004, he has hardly ever been guilty of such an assault. And so a poor showing at home against Australia in late 2004 brought the curtains down on scene one of Yuvraj\'s first act in test cricket.\r\n\r\nAct two also proved to be short-lived, as Yuvraj struggled to cope with the rigours of test cricket, both at home against England and on tour to the West Indies in 2006. Once Sourav Ganguly made his way back into the test side in late 2006, it was always going to be a waiting game for the talented southpaw.

This can help prevent the malware from spreading and/or leaking your private data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you think your PC may have a malware infection, boot your PC into Microsoft&rsquo;s Safe Mode. In this mode, only the minimum required programs and services are loaded. If any malware is set to load automatically when Windows starts, entering in this mode may prevent it from doing so. This is important because it can make removing the nefarious files easier since they&rsquo;re not actually running or active.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sadly, Microsoft has turned the process of booting into safe mode from a relatively easy process in Windows 7 and Windows 8 to one that is decidedly more complicated in Windows 10. To boot into Windows Safe Mode, first click the Start button in Windows 10 and select the Power button as if you were going to reboot, but don&rsquo;t click anything. Next hold down the Shift key and click Reboot. When the full-screen menu appears, select Troubleshooting, then Advanced Options, then Startup Settings. On the next window click the Restart button and wait for the next screen to appear (just stick with us here, we know this is long). Next you will see a menu with numbered startup options; select number 4, which is Safe Mode. Note that if you want to connect to any online scanners you&rsquo;ll need to select option 5, which is Safe Mode with Networking.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may find that your PC runs noticeably faster in Safe Mode.

That just wouldn&rsquo;t cut it for proper PC gaming. Sure, the laptop on its own works well enough for older titles like Diablo III, especially on the laptop&rsquo;s tiny 1366x728-resolution display, but forget about more graphics-intensive modern games on an external 1080p monitor. That&rsquo;s why I decided to examine external graphics card (eGPU) setups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And indeed, I found entire communities of people creating DIY setups that connected desktop graphics cards to their laptops via ExpressCard or mPCIe slots to play games on an external monitor. It isn&rsquo;t hard to configure, and using desktop graphics cards with a laptop has become even easier in recent times. The wide availability of Thunderbolt 3 combined with external graphics card docks has simplified the process even more for people with a modern notebook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nMany do-it-yourself types using Thunderbolt 3, ExpressCard, or mPCIe end up with a plug-and-play experience requiring little to no modification&mdash;though it takes some research first. When it&rsquo;s done, however, you&rsquo;ll be left with a console-toppling PC gaming setup for about the same price as a new Xbox One S, depending on which graphics card you choose. That&rsquo;s far cheaper than building a whole new gaming desktop, and you can still take advantage of your laptop&rsquo;s portability by disconnecting the eGPU hardware.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We&rsquo;ll walk you through the DIY process for configuring an external graphics card later in this article, along with the sudden rise of streaming PC games from the cloud. First, let&rsquo;s tackle the modern approach of using a graphics card dock via Thunderbolt 3.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThunderbolt 3 (TB3) is Intel&rsquo;s high-speed external input/output connection, capable of speeds up to a blistering 40 gigabytes per second (GBps) over a compatible USB-C port. For resource-intensive activities like gaming, a speedy connection between your laptop and an external graphics card provides a big boost for performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier attempts at external graphics card docks existed, but they were usually overpriced and relied on proprietary connection technologies. Thunderbolt 3 levels the playing field, and several companies now offer TB3-based graphics card docks, complete with dedicated power supplies, additional ports, and&mdash;of course&mdash;room to slot desktop graphics cards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All is not perfect in the world of Thunderbolt 3-powered graphics, however. Enclosures are, for the most part, still a pricey proposition&mdash;much more so than the DIY method we&rsquo;ll outline later. You&rsquo;ll also need a relatively new notebook equipped with a Thunderbolt 3-compatible USB-C port. These days most Thunderbolt 3 laptops and graphics card enclosures play nicely together thanks to Intel&rsquo;s Thunderbolt 3 external graphics compatibility technology, which PC makers must specifically enable.</p>\r\n', 'Laptops, Games, Graphics, Cards, PCs', '1', '1', '1'),

These proposals cover packaging, unused heap memory, and application class-data sharing.<br />\r\nJDK 13 is due September 17, 2019, following rampdown and release candidate stages occurring in coming months. JDK Enhancement Proposals eyed for the release cover:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Development of a tool for packaging self-contained Java applications, called jpackage. The tool would be based on the JavaFX javapackager tool that supports native packaging formats to give the user a natural installation experience. It allows launch-time parameters to be specified at packaging time. The tool can be invoked directly from the command line or programmatically via the ToolProvider. Many applications need to be installed on a native platform in a &ldquo;first-class&rdquo; way rather than being placed on the class path or module path. A packaging tool also can fill gaps left by technologies such as Java Web Start, which was removed from Oracle&rsquo;s JDK 11. The javapackager tool was deleted from JDK 11 as part of the removal of JavaFX.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnhancing the ZGC (Z Garbage Collector) to return unused memory to the operating system, a proposal cited as integrated into JDK 13. ZGC, which is billed as a scalable, low-latency collector, currently does not return unused memory back to the OS even if the memory has not been used in a long time. This behavior is not optimal for some applications and environments, especially those where memory footprint is a concern, such as containers or environments where an application might be idle for a long time and is sharing or competing for resources with other applications.<br />\r\nExtending application-class data sharing (AppCDS) to enable dynamic archiving of classes at the end of application execution. Archived classes would include all loaded application and library classes not present in the default, base-layer CDS archive. This proposal, which is in the targeted stage, is intended to improve the usability of AppCDS and eliminate the need for users to do trial runs to create a class list for each application.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Also expected in JDK 13</strong><br />\r\nTwo capabilities anticipated for JDK 13 have been cited previously by Mark Reinhold, chief architect of the Java platform group at Oracle:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raw string literals, which can span multiple lines of source code and do not interpret escape sequences. This capability had been cut from JDK 12, which arrived in March 2019. The plan is to offer raw string literals only as an opt-in beta in JDK 13. Its goal is to make development easier n Java by, for example, letting developersexpress sequences of characters in a readable form free of Java indicators, or supply strings targeted for grammars other than Java. Following the expected test run in JDK 13, raw string literals could be made production-qiality in the subsequent JDK 14 release.<br />\r\nA production version of switch expressions, for which JDK will offer a beta implementation. The switch statement will be extended for use as either a statement or an expression, so both could use either a &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; or &ldquo;simplified&rdquo; scoping and control flow behavior.<br />\r\nWhere to download beta JDK 13 builds<br />\r\nYou can download the JDK 13 builds from the jdk.java.net website.

Seemingly every program you install worms its way into activating alongside your PC. Some software, such as your keyboard&rsquo;s management app or your antivirus, deserves that lofty status. Others don&rsquo;t. (I&rsquo;m looking at you, game launchers.) And every program that leaps to life when Windows does delays your ability to use your system, especially if you haven&rsquo;t upgraded to an SSD yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, it&rsquo;s easy to seize control over which programs launch with Windows. Simply press Ctrl + Shift + Esc or search for &ldquo;Task Manager&rdquo; to open the Windows 10 Task Manager, then click on the Startup tab at the top. There, you&rsquo;ll see all the programs clamoring for a spot in the startup limelight, complete with an estimated impact rating from Low to High. If you want to turn any off, simply click its listing and select Disable. Obviously, doing so means you&rsquo;ll need to open the program manually to activate it from now on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Customize your task bar</strong><br />\r\nNow let&rsquo;s start organizing things a bit better. Launching a program that&rsquo;s pinned to your Windows 10 taskbar is always faster than hunting it down in the Start menu or on your desktop. So you&rsquo;ll want to populate yours with the software and files you use the most.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To pin a program to your taskbar, simply right-click it and select the Pin to taskbar option in the context menu that appears. You can also do this to a program&rsquo;s icon when it appears in your taskbar after opening it. You can pin frequently visited webpages to your taskbar by saving it as a shortcut via your browser&rsquo;s setting menu, then right-clicking that shortcut on your desktop and selecting Pin to taskbar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Folders can only be pinned to the Start menu, alas. You can pin specific files to your taskbar, kinda-sorta, but the process is slightly different, and brings us to our next tip&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Embrace jump lists</strong><br />\r\nNow that you&rsquo;ve pinned your most-used programs to the taskbar, you&rsquo;re ready to take advantage of the awesomeness known as jump lists. When you right-click a program icon in your taskbar, most will reveal a pop-up list of your most recent open files for that program, or shortcuts to common tasks. It&rsquo;s a great way to jump right back into a project without needing to slog through folder after subfolder in the Windows File Explorer.</p>\r\n', 'Windows, Microsoft, Business', '0', '1', '1'),

Sure, the technological leaps behind each new GPU can be interesting on their own, but most everyone just wants to crank up the detail settings on Battlefield and get right to playing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Answering the question can be a bit trickier than it seems. Raw performance is a big part of it, but factors like noise, the driver experience, and supplemental software also play a role in determining which graphics card to buy. And do you want to pay Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX premium to get in on the bleeding edge of real-time ray tracing?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let us make it easy for you. We&rsquo;ve tested nearly every major GPU that&rsquo;s hit the streets over the past couple of years, from $100 budget cards to $1,200 luxury models. Our knowledge has been distilled into this article&mdash;a buying guide with recommendations on which graphics card to buy, no matter what sort of experience you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: There are customized versions of every graphics card from a slew of vendors. For example, you can buy different GeForce GTX 1660 models from EVGA, Asus, MSI, and Zotac, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve linked to our formal review for each recommendation, but the buying links lead to models that stick closely to each graphics card&rsquo;s MSRP. Spending extra can get you hefty out-of-the-box overclocks, beefier cooling systems, and more. Check out our &ldquo;What to look for in a custom card&rdquo; section below for tips on how to choose a customized card that&rsquo;s right for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best low-cost graphics card you can buy right now didn&rsquo;t start off as one. The AMD Radeon RX 570 started off as a $180 refresh of the already-great Radeon RX 470, but now that 2018&rsquo;s cryptocurrency crunch is over and Nvidia&rsquo;s new wave of mainstream GPUs is starting to crest, this family of graphics cards is starting to get cheap. Like, really cheap. &ldquo;You can always find a Radeon RX 570 for $130 with two free games thrown in&rdquo; cheap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s an incredibly enticing price for a superb 1080p graphics card that can hit the hallowed 60 frames per second mark at High or Ultra settings in most modern games. You may need to tinker with some visual settings to achieve that goal, though. Both 4GB and 8GB versions are available. Always take more memory if you can afford it in a graphics card, but the cheaper 4GB models should hold up fine at 1080p resolution in most games.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The insane value proposition of these discounted Radeon RX 570 graphics cards have rendered true budget GPUs like the GeForce GTX 1650, the older GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, and the Radeon RX 560 obsolete unless you need a graphics card that doesn&rsquo;t require any extra power connections. Just get one of these&mdash;and enjoy those free games while you&rsquo;re at it.</p>\r\n', 'Graphics Cards, Hardware, Games, Gaming, Nvidia, AMD, Holiday Gift, Guide', '3', '1', '1');
